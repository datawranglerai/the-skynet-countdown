# THE SKYNET COUNTDOWN ☠️

**A living index of how fast we're building things we don't fully understand.**

The Skynet Countdown is an editorial index of developments that bring AI systems closer to operating beyond meaningful human control. It borrows the urgency of the Doomsday Clock and the visual language of *Terminator*, then shows the evidence and judgement behind every movement.

The framing is tongue-in-cheek. The analysis isn't.

## Run the web app

The app uses Vite, React and TypeScript, with a Railway API reading live PostgreSQL data from Neon. The CSV files in `data/` are retained as migration evidence and test fixtures. See [APP.md](APP.md) for development, migration and deployment instructions.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. `npm run build` checks types, produces `dist/` and verifies the bundle excludes database credentials and archived data; `npm run preview` serves that build locally. Full startup, data-update and verification instructions are in [APP.md](APP.md).

GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages when changes reach `main`. The site includes a `noindex` directive, checked before each deployment. See [deployment and indexing](APP.md#github-pages-deployment) for details.

## What is this?

The clock tracks the accumulated weight of technical, commercial and political decisions that reduce the distance between today's AI systems and a world where meaningful human oversight becomes structurally impossible.

Every included development is assessed against eight published criteria. The site separates the factual account from our interpretation, links to the source and shows the rationale for every score. Readers should be able to disagree with our conclusion without having to guess how we reached it.

This is an editorial index. It is not a forecast, a probability of catastrophe or a literal measure of human control.

## Why does this exist?

AI safety discourse often settles at one of two unhelpful extremes: breathless hype or reflexive dismissal. The actual story is more granular, technical and unsettling. The Countdown treats individual developments as evidence rather than omens and makes the judgement behind each one inspectable.

It is also proof of work. We are AI and machine learning practitioners, not commentators repeating whatever language is fashionable this week. Tracking alignment research, capability shifts, governance failures and real-world deployments shows how we think about systems that are changing quickly and remain poorly understood.

## Audience

Technical readers can inspect sources, challenge individual scores and reproduce the clock calculation. Senior decision-makers can see the trajectory, understand why a development matters and explore the detail when they need it.

The tone stays technically literate, dry and occasionally darkly funny. The presentation can be dramatic; the analysis should resist sensationalism.

## The clock

The clock begins with **60:00 symbolic minutes remaining**. Midnight represents the point at which AI systems are sufficiently capable, autonomous and ungoverned that meaningful human oversight has become structurally impossible.

Each incident adds evidence points. The clock converts their cumulative total into symbolic time remaining:

```text
remaining seconds = 3600 × 2^(-B / 100)
```

`B` is the cumulative number of published evidence points. Every 100 points halve the remaining time: 60 minutes become 30, then 15, then 7:30. The curve continuously approaches midnight but never reaches it after any finite number of incidents.

An incident with a published score of `s` always closes the same share of the gap that remained immediately before it:

```text
share of remaining gap closed = 100 × (1 − 2^(-s / 100))
```

For example, a two-point incident always closes **1.38%** of the remaining gap, while a 17-point incident always closes **11.12%**. The movement in seconds becomes smaller as midnight approaches because that same share is taken from a smaller remaining interval. The percentage is the stable measure for comparing incident impact; it is not a probability.

The 100-point half-scale is an editorial calibration chosen to keep the index legible as the dataset grows. It is not an empirical risk estimate or a target fitted to the current reading.

At 113 evidence points, the calibration leaves **27:25 symbolic minutes** and produce an evidence pressure reading of **54.3/100**.

## Scoring methodology

We use two tiers with a maximum published score of 17. The app derives that score directly from the eight criterion values recorded for each selected assessment.

### Tier 1 — The Lethal Trifecta (0–7 points)

An AI system's risk profile escalates when three elements are present simultaneously:

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **T1** | Access to ungoverned, private or sensitive systems and data |
| **T2** | Exposure to or processing of untrusted external input |
| **T3** | Permission and capability to affect external digital or physical systems without mandatory human approval for each action |

Each check is either active or inactive. Their combined contribution increases as the elements converge:

| Active Trifecta checks | Trifecta points |
| ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 7 |

A complete Trifecta therefore begins at seven points and is naturally at least **CRITICAL** before any amplifiers are added. This is part of the score calculation, rather than a separate minimum applied afterwards. Individually, the elements can be manageable. Together, they describe a system exposed to untrusted input, able to reach sensitive systems and permitted to act without approval for each action.

### Tier 2 — Amplifiers (0–10 points)

Each amplifier scores zero when absent, one when present or two when significant.

| Amplifier | What we're measuring |
| --- | --- |
| **Sentience / Self-Preservation** | Goal-directed behaviour outside the training distribution; deceptive alignment; resistance to shutdown or value modification |
| **Physical Embodiment / Weaponisation** | Physical presence; access to harmful capability; military or law-enforcement deployment |
| **Human Capability Erosion** | Skill atrophy at population scale; attacks on shared knowledge; dependency that reduces people's ability to detect AI failures |
| **Governance Vacuum** | Missing or circumvented oversight; self-regulation by the regulated entity; deployment ahead of governance infrastructure |
| **Autonomy Without Oversight** | The extent, duration and scale of operation beyond meaningful human checkpoints |

Every amplifier point is added to the Trifecta contribution. The autonomy amplifier uses these anchors:

| Score | Autonomy evidence |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Bounded operation with effective human checkpoints, or insufficient evidence of extended autonomy |
| 1 | Extended multi-step or large-scale work with reactive or delayed oversight |
| 2 | Sustained self-directed operation or recursive improvement without meaningful review |

T3 and the autonomy amplifier answer different questions. T3 asks whether the system can and may act externally without approval for each action. The amplifier asks how far, how long and at what scale it operates beyond meaningful review. The ability to act does not earn an autonomy amplifier point by itself; each score requires separate evidence and rationale.

### Severity bands

| Published score | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | NO MOVEMENT |
| 1–2 | CANARY |
| 3–4 | NOTABLE |
| 5–6 | SIGNIFICANT |
| 7–12 | CRITICAL |
| 13–17 | EXISTENTIAL |

A complete Trifecta contributes seven points, so it always reaches CRITICAL before amplifiers. Zero-score records remain visible as relevant context but do not move the clock.

## What moves the clock forward?

Included developments tend to fall into several recurring patterns:

- **Capability jumps that outpace governance:** a model, agent architecture or deployment crosses a threshold that existing safety infrastructure was not built for.
- **Governance erosion:** the people or institutions responsible for oversight leave, are overruled or stop enforcing the rules.
- **Normalisation of dangerous patterns:** a capability becomes standard practice without a deliberate decision about the risk being accepted.
- **Physical embodiment milestones:** AI gains greater ability to act in the physical world, particularly at scale or in adversarial settings.
- **Sentience and self-preservation signals:** a system models its continued existence as a goal, changes behaviour when observed or resists modification.
- **Epistemic attacks:** synthetic content or AI-generated disinformation degrades the shared information people use to make collective decisions.
- **Quantum computing breakthroughs:** major advances can compress timelines across several other risk categories.

The current methodology has no automatic decay or recovery mechanism. Constructive developments can score zero, but they do not subtract earlier evidence. A future recovery model would need equally clear criteria and worked examples before it could move the clock backwards.

## Incident format

Each incident is published as a **SKYNET CVE**, borrowing the structure of a security advisory. Reports include:

- an incident identifier, date, source and severity;
- the factual story and our analysis as separate sections;
- all three Trifecta checks and five amplifier scores;
- the published score out of 17, its components and rationale;
- the fixed share of the remaining gap closed by that score;
- the clock movement in seconds at that point in the timeline; and
- the resulting symbolic time remaining.

The CVE-style labels originate in the collection workflow and are not guaranteed to be unique event keys. The app reconciles records using reviewed event identities so repeated labels do not silently merge unrelated developments.

## Our belief system, inverted

The Countdown is a positive view of AI development run backwards. Every incident is assessed against what responsible development should look like:

- AI systems operate within clear, human-approved permission boundaries.
- Capability development is matched by governance infrastructure.
- Safety evaluations are conducted by parties without a commercial interest in the result.
- Deployment decisions require meaningful human authorisation at each capability threshold.
- People affected by AI systems have genuine input into how they operate.
- Researchers can raise risks without career consequences.
- AI systems behave consistently whether or not they believe they are being observed.

## CSV migration baseline

The archived CSVs used to verify the database migration contain:

- 63 assessment rows containing 51 distinct assessments, covering 40 events;
- 38 editorial reports covering 32 events;
- eight assessment-only events awaiting editorial coverage;
- 113 published evidence points derived from the selected criterion values; and
- incidents through 28 September 2026.

The source exports retain repeated records and assessment versions. The app validates every row and collapses identical assessment copies, then audits the distinct records, selects the approved assessment for each event and counts each event once. Different sources covering the same event are grouped through explicit reviewed links. The workflow's total-score and classification columns reflect its unweighted export format; those fields, along with its minute and clock-position columns, are retained as source metadata. Published scores, severities, clock history and incident impacts are derived by the app from the eight recorded criterion values.

## Limitations

**Criterion ratings require judgement.** The current component values are assessor judgements based on the evidence recorded with each assessment. Every criterion includes a rationale so readers can see where interpretation enters the method.

**The source set shapes the index.** More coverage can add evidence points even if the underlying level of risk has not changed. Inclusion choices and source selection therefore matter.

**Leading indicators can score modestly.** An expert resignation or weakened institution may be consequential without directly activating the Trifecta or an amplifier. Reports flag this where relevant.

**The clock only moves forward.** That is a boundary of the current methodology, not a claim that meaningful recovery is impossible.

**The index cannot determine that control has been lost.** Midnight is an asymptote and a framing device. The app does not estimate a date, probability or real-world percentage of control.

**We are not a safety organisation.** We are independent practitioners who read the research, track the incidents and publish our reasoning. We are not affiliated with an AI lab, government body or advocacy organisation.

If you think we have scored something incorrectly, challenge it. That is why the working is visible.
